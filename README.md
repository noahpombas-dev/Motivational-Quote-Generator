## ðŸš€ About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Noah Pombas, a 14-year-old aspiring developer and tech enthusiast from Switzerland. My journey into the world of coding started with a deep curiosity about how technology works, and it quickly grew into a passion for creating and problem-solving.

I'm currently exploring various programming languages and tools, with interest in web development. I love diving into new challenges and learning something new every day.

On this GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and contributions as I continue to grow my skills. Whether it's a web app or a script, I'm always looking to push the boundaries of what I can create.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, playing video games, or tinkering with new tech gadgets.

Feel free to check out my projects, give feedback, or connect with me on noahpombas.ch. I'm excited to be part of the coding community and can't wait to see where this journey takes me!

ðŸš€ Let's build something amazing together!
